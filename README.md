Deliverable 3
The purpose of this new analysis is to present statistical visualizations on how data differs by city type using a line chart instead of bar/pie charts. The advantage that this chart has over the others is that it shows data over a time frame. 
Results
The multiple line chart is able to show that the different types of cities display similar patterns during the same time periods. The differences in volume are quite obvious though when it comes to total fare. The rural cities have much lower volume than the urban and suburban counterparts. 
Summary 
Based on the results I would suggest that during the end of February that a few more drivers are provided for the rural area. Also, I would suggest that more drivers are allocated to the suburban cities from the rural region during the end of April as fares appear to slump during this time. Lastly, I would also recommend continuing to record these patterns to better plan for the future as they provide good insight on driver allocation which can maximize profits.
